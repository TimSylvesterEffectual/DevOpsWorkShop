<h2> DEVOPS ‐ BUSINESS </h2>

W h y t h e b u s i n e s s s h o u l d c a r e

• DevOps enables the business to act and re-act

faster.

• DevOps often moves from forecasted capital

intensive investment to near actual operating

investment *(Guess how many new servers you’ll*

*need for next year or pay for what you actually*

*use).*

• Quality of the product gets better *(find/fix*

*issues faster, release more features).*

• The business culture is forced to move towards

transparency.

<h2> DEVOPS ‐ TECHNOLOGY </h2>

Why technology should already be here

• Technology becomes partnered with product as opposed to servant to

• Faster throughput for tech products and features

• Automated process replace many archaic manual process

• Loosely coupled services to reduce bottlenecks, increase stability

• Smaller more iterative product releases and less release failure pain
